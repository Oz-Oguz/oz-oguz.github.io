I'm an Asst. Prof. in the area of AI & Robotics at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) and lead of the [Learning for Intelligent Robotic Agents (LiRA) Lab](lira-lab.github.io) in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/en/).
In my research, I focus on algorithms that can enrich the skill set of autonomous agents. 
This entails endowing intelligent systems with effective learning, reasoning, and planning capabilities. <!-- , and manipulation .  -->
Robotics, and a range of other domains that require autonomous decision-making, provide a perfect test-bed for the investigation and application of such methods.
<!-- enable autonomous agent to  task and motion planning in robotics, and learning and reasoning for intelligent systems.  -->

Prior to joining Bilkent U., I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Learning and Intelligence Systems Lab working with [Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de//mtoussai//). I was affiliated with Uni Stuttgart & Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and working within the [Cluster of Excellence: IntCDC](https://www.intcdc.uni-stuttgart.de/). I received my PhD degree from [TU Munich](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lsr/home/), where I focused on HRI in close-proximity scenarios. I studied computer science at [UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [Ko√ß Uni](https://rml.ku.edu.tr/), and started my research journey working on haptic interfaces.

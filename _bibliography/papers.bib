	abstract = {We investigate how collaborative guidance can be realized in multimodal virtual environments for dynamic tasks involving motor control. Haptic guidance in our context can be deﬁned as any form of force/tactile feedback that the computer generates to help a user execute a task in a faster, more accurate, and subjectively more pleasing fashion. In particular, we are interested in determining guidance mechanisms that best facilitate task performance and arouse a natural sense of collaboration. We suggest that a haptic guidance system can be further improved if it is supplemented with a role exchange mechanism, which allows the computer to adjust the forces it applies to the user in response to his/her actions. Recent work on collaboration and role exchange presented new perspectives on deﬁning roles and interaction. However existing approaches mainly focus on relatively basic environments where the state of the system can be deﬁned with a few parameters. We designed and implemented a complex and highly dynamic multimodal game for testing our interaction model. Since the state space of our application is complex, role exchange needs to be implemented carefully. We deﬁned a novel negotiation process, which facilitates dynamic communication between the user and the computer, and realizes the exchange of roles using a three-state ﬁnite state machine. Our preliminary results indicate that even though the negotiation and role exchange mechanism we adopted does not improve performance in every evaluation criteria, it introduces a more personal and humanlike interaction model.},

	abstract = {An active research goal for human-computer interaction is to allow humans to communicate with computers in an intuitive and natural fashion, especially in real-life interaction scenarios. One approach that has been advocated to achieve this has been to build computer systems with human-like qualities and capabilities. In this paper, we present insight on how human-computer interaction can be enriched by employing the computers with behavioral patterns that naturally appear in human-human negotiation scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce a two-party negotiation game specifically built for studying the effectiveness of haptic and audio-visual cues in conveying negotiation related behaviors. The game is centered around a real-time continuous two-party negotiation scenario based on the existing game-theory and negotiation literature. During the game, humans are confronted with a computer opponent, which can display different behaviors, such as concession, competition, and negotiation. Through a user study, we show that the behaviors that are associated with human negotiation can be incorporated into human-computer interaction, and the addition of haptic cues provides a statistically significant increase in the human-recognition accuracy of machine-displayed behaviors. In addition to aspects of conveying these negotiation-related behaviors, we also focus on and report game-theoretical aspects of the overall interaction experience. In particular, we show that, as reported in the game-theory literature, certain negotiation strategies such as tit-for-tat may generate maximum combined utility for the negotiating parties, providing an excellent balance between the energy spent by the user and the combined utility of the negotiating parties.},

One major impediment is that the intermediate policy during the training procedure may result in behaviors that are not only harmful to the system itself but also to the environment. In essence, imposing safety guarantees for learning algorithms is vital for autonomous systems acting in the real world. In this article, we propose a computationally effective and general safe learning framework, specifically for complex dynamical systems. With a proper definition of the safe region, a supervisory control strategy, which switches the actions applied on the system between the learning-based controller and a predefined corrective controller, is given. A simplified system facilitates the estimation of the safe region for the high-dimensional dynamical system. During the learning phase, the belief of the safe region is updated with the actual execution results of the corrective controller, which in turn enables the learning-based controller to have more freedom in choosing its actions. Two examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, one simple inverted pendulum to illustrate the online adaptation method, and one quadcopter control task to show the overall performance.},

Automated planning for such systems enables design analysis tools and facilitates faster design iteration cycles for designers and engineers.

In this paper, we develop a multi-agent TAMP framework for long horizon problems such as constructing a full-scale building. To this end we extend the Logic-Geometric Programming framework by sampling-based motion planning,a limited horizon approach, and a task-specific structural stability optimization that allow an effective decomposition of the task. We show that our framework is capable of constructing a large pavilion built from several hundred geometrically unique building elements from start to end autonomously.},

	abstract = {With the integration of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in industrial assembly scenarios, robot systems face numerous challenges. In contrast to classic robot systems which follow a pre-programmed and ﬁxed sequence of actions, an interaction scenario with humans in the loop requires mutual adaptation. In this paper a framework based on game theory is presented that allows robots to choose appropriate actions with respect to the action of human coworkers when collaborating in close proximity. The proposed framework models HRC scenarios as iterative games and selects action-strategies for the Human-Robot Team (HRT) by ﬁnding the Nash-Equilibria (NEs) of these games. In contrast to most common approaches, our proposed HRC-game treats the decision-making behavior equally for all agents involved. Therefore, the concept of game theory is applied to evaluate the mutual interference of all actions on the HRT to obtain pareto-optimal NEs, i.e. team-optimal action-allocations. The general framework of the proposed HRC-game is realized on an interactive pick-andplace scenario in close proximity. This exemplary HRC-game is tested in a human subject experiment of a KUKA LWR 4+ robot and a human coworker assembling toy-bricks in close proximity. The experimental measurements and statistically signiﬁcant improvements in the subjective feedback hold as a proof-of-concept of the proposed HRC-game model.},

To overcome this, we introduce hierarchies within this framework, where on coarser levels a problem with less discrete decisions is solved. Formally, the hierarchies are deﬁned in a way that the resulting nonlinear programs on coarser hierarchy levels are lower bounds on the ﬁner hierarchies. We demonstrate the generality of the approach for both a bi-manual manipulation task and a mobile manipulation scenario which includes a “worm” like walking robot.},

A recurrent neural network-based framework is constructed to learn a policy that computes control signals for a robot end effector in order to replace one human. The learned policy is benchmarked against unseen interaction data and a state-of-the-art learning from demonstration framework in simulated scenarios. We compare several architectures and investigate a new activation function of three stacked tanh().

For safety, the robot must be able to avoid dynamic obstacles such as a human arm with high reliability. For comfort, the trajectories and avoidance behavior of the robot need to be predictable to the humans. Moreover, these two aspects might be different from person to person or from one task to another. This work presents a framework to generate predictable motions with dynamic obstacle avoidance for the robot interacting with the human by using policy improvement method. The trajectories are generated using Dynamic Motion Primitives with an additional potential field term that penalizes trajectories that may lead to collisions with obstacles. Furthermore, human movements are predicted using a data-driven approach for proactive avoidance. A cost function is defined which measures different aspects that affect the comfort and predictability of human co-workers (e.g. human response time, joint jerk). This cost function is then minimized during human-robot interaction by the means of policy improvement through black-box optimization to generate robot trajectories that adapt to human preferences and avoid obstacles. User studies are performed to evaluate the trust and comfort of human co-workers when working with the robot. In addition, the studies are also extended to various scenarios and different users to analyze the task transferability. This improves the learning performance when switching to a new task or the robot has to adapt to a different co-worker.},

	abstract = {Robots collaborating naturally with a human partner in a confined workspace need to understand and predict human motions. For understanding, a model-based approach is required as the human motor control system relies on the biomechanical properties to control and execute actions. The model-based control models explain human motions descriptively, which in turn enables predicting and analyzing human movement behaviors. In motor control, reaching motions are framed as an optimization problem. However, different optimality criteria predict disparate motion behavior. Therefore, the inverse problem -- finding the optimality criterion from a given arm motion trajectory -- is not unique. This paper implements an inverse optimal control (IOC) approach to determine the combination of cost functions that governs a motion execution. The results indicate that reaching motions depend on a trade-off between kinematics and dynamics related cost functions. However, the computational efficiency is not sufficient for online prediction to be utilized for HRI. In order to predict human reaching motions with high efficiency and accuracy, we combine the IOC approach with a probabilistic movement primitives formulation. This hybrid model allows an online-capable prediction while taking into account motor variability, and the interpersonal differences. The proposed framework affords a descriptive and a generative model of human reaching motions which can be effectively utilized online for human-in-the-loop robot control and task execution.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to optimal online motion planning for human-robot interaction scenarios. For a safe, comfortable, and efficient interaction between human and robot working in close proximity, robot motion has to be agile and perceived as natural by the human partner. The robot has to be aware of its environment, including human motions, in order to proactively take actions while ensuring safety, and task fulfillment. Human motion prediction constitutes the fundamental perception input for the motion planner. The prediction system, which is based on probabilistic movement primitives, generates a prediction of human motion as a trajectory distribution learned in an offline phase. The proposed stochastic optimization-based planning algorithm then progressively finds feasible optimization parameters to replan the motion online that ensures collision avoidance while minimizing the task-related trajectory cost. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach produces collision-free trajectories while still reaching the goal successfully. We also highlight the performance of our planner in comparison to previous methods in stochastic motion planning.},

	abstract = {Within Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) safety is one key-issue that has to be guaranteed at any time during joint collaboration. Collisions in a shared workspace of a Human-Robot-Team (HRT) must be prevented. In addition, the comfort of the collaboration behavior should be provided. Facing these challenges, a robot has to be able to detect critical states at an early stage on the one hand and should react to them within a very short time span on the other hand. In this paper a collision avoidance algorithm using compliance control that guarantees a fast reaction to dynamic obstacles, e.g. humans, without the need of high computational effort is outlined. To further improve the avoidance behavior of the robot, a human motion prediction algorithm based on the minimum-jerk model is integrated. In an experimental analysis of a case-study about collecting LEGO-bricks on a table with various subjects, the impact of the integration of human motion prediction on both the robot’s reaction time and human’s perception of the robot co-worker is studied. Finally, the comfort and acceptance of the robot colleague by the human collaborator is drawn out through an analysis of the subjective human feedback questionnaires.},

	abstract = {Robotic assembly planning has the potential to profoundly change how buildings can be designed and created. It enables architects to explicitly account for the assembly process already during the design phase, and enables efficient building methods that profit from the robots' different capabilities. Previous work has addressed planning of robot assembly sequences and identifying the feasibility of architectural designs. This paper extends previous work by enabling assembly planning with large, heterogeneous teams of robots. We present a scalable planning system which enables parallelization of complex task and motion planning problems by iteratively solving smaller sub-problems. Combining optimization methods to solve for manipulation constraints with a sampling-based bi-directional space-time path planner enables us to plan cooperative multi-robot manipulation with unknown arrival-times. Thus, our solver allows for completing sub-problems and tasks with differing timescales and synchronizes them effectively. We demonstrate the approach on multiple case-studies and on two long-horizon building assembly scenarios to show the robustness and scalability of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {Sequential decision-making and motion planning for robotic manipulation induce combinatorial complexity. For long-horizon tasks, especially when the environment comprises many objects that can be interacted with, planning efficiency becomes even more important. To plan such long-horizon tasks, we present the RHH-LGP algorithm for combined task and motion planning (TAMP). First, we propose a TAMP approach (based on Logic-Geometric Programming) that effectively uses geometry-based heuristics for solving long-horizon manipulation tasks. We further improve the efficiency of this planner by a receding horizon formulation, resulting in RHH-LGP. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach on several long-horizon tasks that require reasoning about interactions with a large number of objects. Using our framework, we can solve tasks that require multiple robots, including a mobile robot and snake-like walking robots, to form novel heterogeneous kinematic structures autonomously.},
